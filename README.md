### LINKLIFY
 The plan is to build a linktree for web3 idolos, where they can add project links && socails links

## MVC
- signup
- dashboard where links can be added a or removed


## PLAN
- I will build a seperate api with php ,that will validate users
- The api will also return the users linktree data like links stored blah blah

## UPDATE

- Now signup form data is being sent directly to the API (I know it's a security flaw and I'll add some validations soon, but any data sent from anywhere is also being validated and sanitized at the API, won't this cause a delay or speed issue?)

- The sign up and signin page now looks like what I see in recent websites
